## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes (`src/app/dashboard/traffictrace/page.tsx`)

#### Summary Cards Section
```jsx
{/* Summary Cards - Moved to Top */}
{stores.length > 0 && (
  <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-6">
    {/* Total Visitors, Page Views, Bounce Rate, Avg Session cards */}
  </div>
)}
```

#### Store List Section
```jsx
{/* Website Analytics - Moved Below Summary Cards */}
<Card className="bg-gradient-to-br from-[#2A2153]/90 to-[#2A2153]/70 border-[#3D3A6E] p-6 backdrop-blur-sm shadow-2xl">
  <div className="space-y-4">
    {stores.map((store: StoreConnection) => (
      <div key={store.id} className="bg-gradient-to-br from-purple-600/10 to-pink-600/10 rounded-lg p-4 border border-purple-400/20">
        <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
          <div className="flex-1">
            <div className="flex items-center justify-between mb-3">
              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white">{store.storeName}</h3>
              <Button onClick={() => { setSelectedStore(store); setShowWebsiteModal(true); }}>
                <Settings className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
                Tracking Settings
              </Button>
            </div>
            {/* Store details grid */}
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    ))}
  </div>
</Card>
```

#### Updated State Management
- Removed dropdown selection logic
- Updated `useEffect` to automatically select first store for data calculations
- Modified modal form initialization to work with individually selected stores

## üìä Data Flow

### Summary Cards Data
- **Source**: Aggregated from the first store's traffic analytics
- **Metrics**: Total Visitors, Page Views, Bounce Rate, Average Session Duration
- **Display**: Always visible when stores are available

### Store List Data

- **Per Store Info**:
  - Store Name and URL
  - Provider (Shopify, Etsy, etc.)
  - Connection Status

  - Last Update Date
  - Individual Tracking Settings Button

### Individual Store Settings
- **Trigger**: Click "Tracking Settings" button for specific store
